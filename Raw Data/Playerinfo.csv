Tom Banton,England,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper,Opening Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323000/323099.png","Tom Banton was the breakout star of the 2019 domestic season as his flamboyant strokemaking at the top of the Somerset order catapulted him into England's T20 squad and drew attention from franchises from around the world. A tall, inventive player who has drawn regular comparisons with Kevin Pietersen and Jos Buttler, Banton's most eye-catching shots are his hockey-inspired reverse-slaps and scoops, though he is equally adept driving straight down the ground and hitting through midwicket. "
James Michael Vince,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323000/323001.png","With a wide range of strokes and an ability to time the ball shared by few, it was understandable that England's selectors kept providing opportunities to James Vince."

But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann."
Eoin Joseph Gerard Morgan,England,Moggie,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316564.png","Eoin Morgan became England's ODI captain in slightly chaotic circumstances less than two months before the 2015 World Cup and was less than enamoured with an entirely inadequate campaign. What he observed, not just from his own side's lacklustre display, but the inspiration provided by Brendon McCullum's New Zealand side, convinced him an entirely new approach was necessary, with a policy of no fear (and no retribution) at its heart. It required a man of strong will not just to say it, but to implement it, but Morgan did so, seeking to fashion an England side that would play with courage and be impervious to pressure or criticism."
Samuel William Billings,England,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322900/322932.png","Sam Billings, an energetic and inventive wicketkeeper-batter with a penchant for the white-ball game, slots into a long line of illustrious Kent keepers including Les Ames, Godfrey Evans, Alan Knott and Geraint Jones. Billings is an all-round sportsman who turned down a football trial with Tottenham Hotspur to go on a cricket tour at county level, once woke up in an infirmary after being spear tackled in a rugby union game, achieved county junior level in tennis, and is highly adept at squash and racquets."
Liam Andrew Dawson,England,"Daws, Lemmy",Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323109.png","The selection of Liam Dawson in England's World T20 squad in 2016 carried a message of hope for all cricketers dutifully plying their trade on the county circuit. In Hampshire's T20 campaign of 2015 Dawson played two games, scored three runs in one knock and did not take a wicket; he scored three in his solitary T20 innings. With his career faltering, he was loaned out to Essex for a month. Then, on his return to Hampshire, came a remarkable transformation."
Christopher James Jordan,England,CJ,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316623.png","Chris Jordan, a fast bowler with a level-headed calmness and a fearsome yorker, found his niche as a death specialist in T20 cricket for England after initially breaking through as a bowling allrounder in Tests and ODIs.

Adil Usman Rashid,England,"Dilly, Hoover",Right hand Bat,Legbreak,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319700/319741.png","Adil Rashid did much to set right English cricket's troubled relationship with legspin when he established himself as the country's leading white-ball spinner in 2015 and four years later was a key part of their World Cup-winning side. At the time of Rashid's recall to the limited-overs set-up in 2015, no legspinner had taken more than five white-ball wickets for England; over the next six years, Rashid took more than 200."
Saqib Mahmood,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323000/323019.png","Saqib Mahmood announced himself as a bowler of international class during England's ODI series against Pakistan in 2021. England were forced to pick a completely new squad at short notice after a number of Covid-19 cases were detected in their initial group leaving Mahmood to take the new ball in the first ODI in Cardiff; he dismissed Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam inside three balls, finished with 4 for 42, and was named player of the series as England romped to a 3-0 win."
Tymal Solomon Mills,England,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323104.png","Tymal Mills won an England recall for the 2021 T20 World Cup after four-and-a-half years in the international wilderness, during which time regular injuries had threatened his career. Mills, one of the most explosive fast bowlers in English cricket and an innovative thinker about the short-form game, was diagnosed with a congenital back condition in 2015 - his spinal cord and vertebrae are unusually close together and bowling fast too often can agitate his spinal cord - which consigned him to a career as a T20 specialist but he embraced life on the franchise circuit."
Brandon Alexander King,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Top order Batter,West Indies,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321900/321983.png","Brandon King got his start as a solid middle-order batter for Jamaica before a promotion to the top order in the CPL unlocked his power-hitting potential, and culminated in a call-up to West Indies' white-ball side."
Shai Diego Hope,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Wicketkeeper,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320100/320122.png","Shai Hope made his Test debut as a 21-year-old, having played just 14 first-class matches at the time. But few in the Caribbean doubted his talent as a batsman. Clive Lloyd gave him his West Indies cap, and coach Stuart Law insisted that he only needed one innings to get going. The world eventually got to know why the boy from Barbados was rated so highly when he became the first player, in 534 first-class matches, to score a hundred in each innings at Headingley."
Nicholas Pooran,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320100/320109.png","Nicholas Pooran confirmed his status as one of the most exciting young batting talents in the modern game with a sublime innings of 118 off 103 in West Indies' defeat to Sri Lanka at the 2019 World Cup, but only four years earlier the idea that he would play international cricket seemed fanciful."
Darren Michael Bravo,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Occasional Wicketkeeper,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316616.png","Darren Bravo is living proof that imitation is the best form of flattery and learning. Only he chose to do it with one of the most inimitable masters of the game. To try to imitate is one thing, to pull it off at Test level, to imbibe it so much that it becomes you, is quite another. Brian Lara's cousin and Dwayne Bravo's half-brother, the younger Bravo, used to watch cricket only for Lara. As soon as Lara would get out, Bravo would switch off the TV and go out to bat."
Kieron Adrian Pollard,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batting Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320100/320107.png","Kieron Pollard had a batting average of 11.30 from 15 ODIs and 17.20 from 10 T20Is when he became the joint-biggest buy at the IPL player auction in January 2010. Mumbai Indians weren't paying $750,000 (plus an undisclosed amount to break a tie with three other franchises) for Pollard's international record; they were shelling out all that money for the fearsome hitting power he had shown in domestic T20 action - most notably while smashing 54 off 18 balls for T&T against New South Wales during the 2009 Champions League T20."
Jason Omar Holder,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowling Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316673.png","Jason Holder was seen as a future talent until a selection panel headed by former World Cup-winner Clive Lloyd appointed him West Indies' ODI captain in 2014. Holder was only 23 at the time, and was still making his way as a fast bowler and a lower-middle order batsman. Less than a year later, he took over the Test team too, indicating how much the WICB and men in the know - ranging from Viv Richards to Brian Lara to Tony Cozier - believed in this man, who comes across as remarkably level-headed and mature for someone so young.

He had begun the season billed as the ""belligerent face of England's next generation"" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine."
Philip Dean Salt,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/324200/324245.png","Phil Salt's fearless ball-striking at the top of the Sussex order earned him attention from across the global T20 circuit and a maiden England call-up in 2019, though he was made to wait until 2021 for his debut when he performed a passable impression of Jason Roy in the Covid-hit ODI series against Pakistan."
Harry Cherrington Brook,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/324200/324246.png","A former England U19s captain, Harry Brook announced himself as a player with a bright future with a remarkable T20 Blast season in 2020, averaging 55 and striking at 163 in the group stages despite batting in the middle order."

After making his BBL debut for the Brisbane Heat in 2013-14, his initial forays into state cricket came for Queensland, but in 2015 he signed a rookie deal with Tasmania. After a few years of hovering on the fringes of domestic cricket, McDermott blasted into the spotlight in the 2016-17 BBL when he smashed 114 off 52 balls to set the Hobart Hurricanes on the path to a remarkable win at Etihad Stadium, chasing down the Melbourne Renegades' score of 222, which had been the highest total in BBL history. His innings was also, at the time, the second-highest individual score in BBL history.ESPNcricinfo staff"

A versatile and hard-hitting batter, he enjoyed a breakthrough Sheffield Shield season in 2020-21 with 585 runs including his first three first-class hundreds having previously churned out runs at grade level without quite making the step up. That followed consecutive 400-plus run seasons for Scorchers in the BBL - where his adaptability at moving from the top order to the middle was noted by selectors - and having continued to flay runs in county cricket for Leicestershire he was named in Australia's 2021 T20 World Cup despite not being part of any of the previous series.

It is not just his power that worries opposing bowlers and captains. His ability to make unconventional shots appear routine - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments."

A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."

Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon. Hazlewood was initially chosen for Australia's Test tour of India in late 2010 but was withdrawn due to a back stress injury, and it was not until four years later that he finally played his first Test, having added significant strength to his 196cm frame."

Mushfiqur was principally selected as an understudy to the ever-present wicketkeeper, Khaled Mashud, but his inclusion was further evidence of Bangladesh's determination to build for a better future. He had done well on an A-team tour of Zimbabwe earlier in 2005, scoring a century in the first Test at Bulawayo, and also enjoyed some success in England the previous year with the Under-19s, making 88 in the second Test at Taunton. He showed more evidence of grit with the full team, with a maiden first-class half-century to soften the pain of defeat against Sussex, followed by a career-best 115 against Northamptonshire. That earned him a call-up - as a batsman - to become the youngest player to appear in a Test match at Lord's. He was one of only three players to reach double figures in a disappointing first innings, but a twisted ankle kept him out of the second Test. After captaining Bangladesh's Under-19s to fifth place in the Youth World Cup in February 2006, he also featured in Bogra's inaugural Test, against Sri Lanka the following month, but could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara.

He plays for the Raukele Club and is regarded as a brilliant fielder. He was on a scholarship to play grade cricket in Brisbane but had to return due to an injured ankle.

But for someone who played an international for the first time in two years in January 2019, Mohammad Rizwan was spoken of remarkably frequently.

A left-handed opener with an unusually high backlift, Zaman relies on timing for his runs, which he's made plenty of. This is illustrated by his domestic average (42 in first class cricket and 49 in List A). But it wasn't until the Quaid-e-Azam trophy in 2016-17 that his form began to be noticed. Zaman scored 663 runs in the competition at an average of 51, including 170 in the second innings of the final, a game dominated by the twin centuries of former Pakistan captain Salman Butt."

He made his first-class debut at the age of 19 and impressive against Lahore Ravi with a four-wicket haul in the first innings. His career started with club cricket and rose up to the regional Under-16 level but he did not make youth squads at national level. However, he managed to gain some attention in the 2015 National T20 Cup in where he picked up eight wickets in four matches under the captaincy of Shoaib Malik. His 17 wickets at 17.05 in the National One-Day cup in 2016 was a key part of him being promoted to the Pakistan side. Peshawar Zalmi head coach Mohammad Akram had been monitoring this process at the domestic circuit and snapped him form the emerging category in Pakistan Super League."

During the Lord's Ashes Test against England in August 2019, Steven Smith was felled by Jofra Archer's bouncer and Labuschagne would become his concussion substitute - the first time in Test history the protocol had been used. By the end of the year he had eclipsed Smith as the leading Test run-scorer in the world, and locked in the No. 3 spot, in the midst of a prolific home summer that brought him four centuries in five matches against Pakistan and New Zealand including a double century at the SCG."

Amjad Khan is a rarity: a Danish fast bowler. Born in Copenhagen, he became the youngest person to ever play for Denmark at the age of 17 and in his first full season at Kent in 2002, he claimed an impressive 63 wickets. He failed to regain that form in the following seasons, but 2005 heralded an upturn as he played a significant part in Kent's challenge for the title by taking 55 wickets. "

After four years on the MCC groundstaff - longer than usual but Clive Radley, the head coach, admitted he was ""a bloody good bloke to have around"" -, in 2006 he made 40 in his only Championship appearance for Warwickshire, and in 2007 he moved to Derbyshire where he hit 100 not out on his debut at Cambridge.

Van der Dussen had also been part of South Africa A's tour to India earlier that year, and the accumulated effect of his experience in such a wide variety of conditions has made him a dynamic, adaptable batsman at the top of the order or in the middle.A naturally attacking batsman, van der Dussen has also been able to
translate his talents into long-format cricket and was top-scorer in South Africa's first-class domestic competition in 2017-18, as well as being Lions' vice-captain. But it was his success in cricket's shortest formats that made van der Dussen impossible to ignore.He was an integral part of the Vancouver Knights team that won the 2018 Global T20 Canada, after which he was recruited by St Kitts & Nevis Patriots in the Caribbean Premier League and capped the year by topping the batting charts with 469 runs at a strike rate of 138.75 in Jozi Stars' run to the inaugural Mzansi Super League title. Van der Dussen transitioned easily into international cricket, striking a fifty on T20I debut against Zimbabwe and following that up with 93 in his first ODI against Pakistan.Liam Brickhill"

Miller is a self-styled finisher who is strong off the front and back foot and eager to swing his arms, as well as a gun fielder. "

He earned the early call-up through some impressive work at the BKSP, the country's biggest sports institute. At the same time, he was a regular in the Bangladesh age-group teams. By November 2009, he had established himself in the Under-19 team and went on to hit 13 centuries before his ODI debut against West Indies in November 2012. At the same time, he won positive reviews for his glovework and batting for Dhaka Gladiators in the Bangladesh Premier League T20 competition. "

Buttler helped bring England's limited-overs batting into the 21st century, his impact on the one-day and T20 sides extraordinary as they turned a group-stage exit in the 2015 World Cup into a triumph on home soil four years later, with his efforts with the bat and the gloves crucial to their Super-Over victory in the final. In an 18-month period from mid-2014, he scored what at the time were England's three fastest one-day hundreds - thrilling innings against Sri Lanka at Lord's, New Zealand at Edgbaston and, topping the list, a 46-ball onslaught against Pakistan in Dubai.

One Test later, he scooped his maiden Man-of-the-Match award, after four first-innings wickets and a thrilling counter-attacking half-century had given England the edge in a gripping Edgbaston Test against India.

Williams is as adept at the stroke as either of these two elder statesmen of Zimbabwean cricket, which he proved during the course of his maiden Test century against New Zealand in Bulawayo in July 2016.

Patel started his career in the lower middle order, but has since moved up the order and his best ODI performance to date came as an opener when he cracked 92 to help seal a six-wicket win over Netherlands in Nairobi in February 2010. He had to pull out of Kenya's squad for their Intercontinental Cup game against Canada in August 2009 when his father passed away, and captain Maurice Ouma dedicated the victory in that game ""to my team-mate's dad"".

Perhaps not yet, but Jon-Jon Smuts is an aggressive, clean-hitting opening batsman who has made a name as one of the most entertaining cricketers to watch in shorter formats. He has been a cricketer since he could see over the top of a pair of pads at the age of six, he is unusual in that he opens the batting in all three formats, and he is no mean left-arm spinner. Smuts was part of the South African squad that reached the semi-finals of the Under-19 World Cup against Pakistan in Sri Lanka in 2007-08. In fact, it was Smuts' 58 - which earned him Man-of-the-Match honours - that put the South Africans in the final, which they lost to India. Smuts was also in the South African squad that won the 2010 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia.
But it took Smuts several seasons before he was able to break through at the highest level. Despite finishing fifth in the first-class competition's batting charts in the 2011-12 season, when he averaged 43.64, Smuts positioned himself more as a limited-overs cricketer. He was third among run-scorers in the 2014-15 season's one-day cup, scoring 592 runs at 59.20 with six fifties to his name. His reputation for big hitting earned him a CPL contract in 2016. Smuts finished as the leading run-scorer in South Africa's domestic T20 competition in the 2016-17 season and was finally selected in South Africa's T20 squad to play Sri Lanka in three matches in January 2017.ESPNcricinfo staff

Philippe's call-up came on the back of an outstanding Big Bash campaign for the Sydney Sixers where he was Man of the Match in the final and finished the tournament with three half-centuries in four innings. He is a wonderful timing of the ball with the full 360-degree range of shots, his power in display during the 2019-2020 BBL when he launched a six onto the roof of the pavilion at the SCG. "

At 6'8"", he is one of the tallest fast bowlers in the circuit. And like most people who send a cricket ball down from such awkward heights, he is known for getting awkward bounce.

But a lack of respect, for opposition bowlers at least, has served Gayle well since then. Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers.

Spotted in the nets by Brian Lara, he was called up for his Test debut after just one match for Barbados, and promptly took five wickets against Sri Lanka in Jamaica in June 2003. He added five in his first overseas Test, and six in his first one-day international. With a round-arm action not unlike Jeff Thomson's, which has left him vulnerable to back strains, he was more of a protégé of his neighbour Corey Collymore than his half-brother Pedro Collins. He bowls fast, can swing the ball and get reverse swing, but insists that he does not go for out-and-out pace. "

That debut, in Mohali in 2012-13, came to Dhawan in his ninth year of first-class cricket after he had been written off by almost everybody, not least because India's opening combination had been fixed to the most prolific combination in their Test history: Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir."

With the new ball, Thakur's at-the-batsman method forms a neat counterpoint to Dhawal Kulkarni's more metronomic style, and the two combined brilliantly to win Mumbai their 41st Ranji Trophy title in February 2016. Thakur picked up eight wickets in the final against Saurashtra, and his dismissal of Cheteshwar Pujara on the third day, the ball rearing up from a length to hit the shoulder of the bat, was perhaps the ball of the match."

He began by playing taped tennis ball cricket in his hometown Bagerhat, but his talents were discovered during a pacer hunt programme where he topped the speed gun. He made his cricketing debut in 2007, against Khulna Division, for whom his hero Mashrafe Mortaza plays. That didn't stop him from bouncing Mortaza and picking up his wicket during their first encounter at a local competition. When Hossain entered the domestic scene, there were instances of batsmen retiring hurt because of his stock delivery. His love for speed also explains his fascination for bikes. "

Seelaar is not a great spinner of the ball but his economy rate is good and, despite being just 21 years old, knows his game well.

Seelaar's favourite player is another left-arm spinner who started young - Daniel Vettori.

Fletcher had already made his limited-overs debut for West Indies by then, but his prime opportunities came in T20 leagues around the world - the CPL, the BPL, the PSL and the BBL, but surprisingly not the IPL.

A spate of injuries in the New Zealand squad led to a Test debut for Bracewell in Bulawayo, and he took six in that game to make a quick impact. The Hobart performance reinforced the feeling that Bracewell could be a vital cog in New Zealand's bowling wheels for years to come.ESPNcricinfo staff "

Having played for the Under-19 side, he was handed his first call-up in 2010 - taking three wickets on his ODI debut against Bangladesh - and made his Test debut in the same match as Kane Williamson. They were contrasting affairs. While Williamson scored a century in Ahmedabad, Bennett bowled 15 wicketless overs before picking up a groin strain. It remains his only Test. With the white-ball he found more success. He did enough to earn a place in the 2011 World Cup squad, but after that it was three years until be played again. In two matches against India he was good enough to work over Virat Kohli, but it was a brief comeback as a series of niggling injuries hampered his progress. After a long stint with his native Canterbury he shifted north to Wellington and his career was revitalised with a superb 2017 season which earned him a recall to the national side

He bowls finger spin with both arms, and does it with skill and accuracy - his offbreaks not quite as good as his left-arm orthodox, but not far off. Understandably, his potential has impressed coaches. In the age of T20, a bowler who can spin it away from both right and left-handers, not to mention employ different lines of attack to the same batsman, could potentially have team owners and data analysts drooling, so long as Kamindu continues to develop those skills.

He made his ODI debut against Australia in January 2005 and, in June, he was named West Indies' Youth Cricketer of the Year. Test opportunities came in Sri Lanka in the same year but his results were disappointing and he disappeared from the national radar for several years. When he re-emerged it was for a surprise Test recall against Australia in Antigua in 2008 - a surprise because he had made only two half-centuries in Jamaica's successful first-class campaign in 2007-08.

While he had the leadership skills to captain his club team, Willow Cuts, to domestic honours in the 2006 Premier Two-Day League, Jones's occasional lapses of temperament have caused questions to be asked about his discipline and commitment. More of a batsman in his early youth, Jones has latterly focused on his bowling and his selection to the national side was based mainly on his skills in that area. He won the Best Young Player award at the end of Bermuda's domestic season in 2006 while his father, Olin, collected the award for best player. Jones made his senior one-day debut against Kenya in November 2006, playing at the World Cup and then joining Bermuda's Under-19 squad at the Under-19 World Cup in 2008. Part of Bermuda's squad for the Intercontinental Shield competition in 2009-10, Jones nevertheless struggled as his own performances mirrored that of his team.

With a bouncing, high-kneed approach to the crease and a bagful of variations, his initial value to Afghanistan was as an enterprising legspinner but his batting has become increasingly useful. He pays precious little regard to the textbook, but Shenwari's good eye means that when he hacks violently at the ball, more often than not he connects and he's crept up from Afghanistan's lower order into their middle. He's also a capable fielder, and is often stationed at point. Shenwari helped to engineer Afghanistan's historic win over Bangladesh at the Asia Cup in March 2014, sharing in a 164-run stand with Asghar Stanikzai and then picking up the vital wicket of Mominul Haque. He has been part of all of Afghanistan's World T20 campaigns, and was shortlisted for the prize of ICC Associate and Affiliate player of the year in 2014. He was an automatic pick for the team that travelled to the 2015 World Cup.Liam Brickhill"

He remained in the frame after his debut and played a useful role in Afghanistan's qualification for the 2012 World T20.

A tall seam bowler, he hits the pitch hard and can get good away movement - but as with many young quick bowlers consistency is his major problem. Technically, he has a good action but a better brace of his front leg through his delivery stride would allow him to make the most of his height, rather than collapsing as he tends to do at the moment. He made his ODI debut against England in October 2004 and caused the England top-order a few anxious moments. His early Test appearances did not set the world alight, and he lost his place after taking 3 for 343 in four matches - but he has the basics and anyone with a semblance of talent should be encouraged and nurtured. Mpofu has benefited noticeably from Heath Streak's appointment as Zimbabwe's bowling coach as his action has smoothed out, his outswing is becoming more consistent (although he still has a frustrating propensity to go too wide of off stump) and his pace has increased. One definite shortcoming, however, is his crease occupation. Not content with being stumped twice in an afternoon (for a pair) in the first Test against New Zealand in August 2005, he followed up by being run out for 3 in the second match, as he strolled down the pitch to congratulate his team-mate on reaching his half-century.  He still tends to blow hot and cold and has few rivals in the race to be considered international cricket's worst batsman, but when Zimbabwe return to Test cricket Mpofu will have an important role to play.

That earned him an IPL deal and an Australia call-up. He impressed in a T20I tri-series for the national side before struggling in India.

An average of just over 25 in his first two seasons on the benign tracks of Bangladesh, and injuries to senior pacemen including Mashrafe Mortaza, earned the youngster a call-up to the national ODI squad for the home tri-series against India and Sri Lanka. He made his debut against Sri Lanka in the opening game of the series in January 2010. Cricinfo Staff "

Al-Amin Hossain, born and bred in Jhenidah in the south of the country, is the next man in line, and he started his international career in 2013 after becoming a viable option through impressive starts in domestic cricket.

You won't like him when he's angry. Well over six feet tall, with flowing jet black hair and a piercing gaze, Shapoor's run-up begins most of the way to the boundary and he's built a name for himself with pace, bounce and aggression as a left-arm seamer. As an out-and-out fast bowler there is, of course, always a hostile element to his bowling and as Shapoor explains it: ""I am angry every time I bowl. A bowler has to be angry, so that his reaction can carry over to the batsmen, who get unsettled and end up making a mistake."""
William Boyd Rankin,Ireland,Boydo,Left hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319800/319871.png","Boyd Rankin first came to prominence as part of the Ireland team that progressed to the Super Eight section of the 2007 World Cup. Blessed with great height - Rankin is six feet, seven inches tall - he gained bounce from even the most sluggish of surfaces and claimed 12 wickets in the tournament to help his side to notable victories over Pakistan and Bangladesh. Five years later, he made himself unavailable for Ireland in a bid to play Test cricket with England. The move provoked disquiet in his home country but it appeared to have been justified when he was named in England's Ashes squad to tour Australia in 2013-14, after a series of impressive limited-overs displays for his adoptive country. Progress was fitful, though, and he restored his allegiance with Ireland as 2015 drew to a close."

Over 2007 and 2008, he also emerged, still improbably young, as a hot pace prospect. Even before he went to England on an U-19 tour, he had been picked out as a special talent by Akram himself at a pace camp he oversaw in Lahore in May 2007. By 2010, he had become the hottest pace bowling prospect around the world - but within months his career was in ruins following charges of spot-fixing. "
