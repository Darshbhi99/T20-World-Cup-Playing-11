Tom Banton,England,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323000/323099.png","Tom Banton was the breakout star of the 2019 domestic season as his flamboyant strokemaking at the top of the Somerset order catapulted him into England's T20 squad and drew attention from franchises from around the world. A tall, inventive player who has drawn regular comparisons with Kevin Pietersen and Jos Buttler, Banton's most eye-catching shots are his hockey-inspired reverse-slaps and scoops, though he is equally adept driving straight down the ground and hitting through midwicket.

James Vince,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323000/323001.png","With a wide range of strokes and an ability to time the ball shared by few, it was understandable that England's selectors kept providing opportunities to James Vince."
Moeen Ali,England,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Batting Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316557.png","Moeen Ali was tipped for the top long before he won his Test debut at the start of 2014. But, after building a reputation as an elegant batter, it was his offspin bowling that earned him the call-up when England were left reeling from the surprise retirement of Graeme Swann."
Eoin Morgan,England,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Middle order Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316500/316564.png","Eoin Morgan became England's ODI captain in slightly chaotic circumstances less than two months before the 2015 World Cup and was less than enamoured with an entirely inadequate campaign. What he observed, not just from his own side's lacklustre display, but the inspiration provided by Brendon McCullum's New Zealand side, convinced him an entirely new approach was necessary, with a policy of no fear (and no retribution) at its heart. It required a man of strong will not just to say it, but to implement it, but Morgan did so, seeking to fashion an England side that would play with courage and be impervious to pressure or criticism."
Samuel Billings,England,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/322900/322932.png","Sam Billings, an energetic and inventive wicketkeeper-batter with a penchant for the white-ball game, slots into a long line of illustrious Kent keepers including Les Ames, Godfrey Evans, Alan Knott and Geraint Jones. Billings is an all-round sportsman who turned down a football trial with Tottenham Hotspur to go on a cricket tour at county level, once woke up in an infirmary after being spear tackled in a rugby union game, achieved county junior level in tennis, and is highly adept at squash and racquets."
Liam Dawson,England,Right hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323109.png","The selection of Liam Dawson in England's World T20 squad in 2016 carried a message of hope for all cricketers dutifully plying their trade on the county circuit. In Hampshire's T20 campaign of 2015 Dawson played two games, scored three runs in one knock and did not take a wicket; he scored three in his solitary T20 innings. With his career faltering, he was loaned out to Essex for a month. Then, on his return to Hampshire, came a remarkable transformation."
Chris Jordan,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316623.png","Chris Jordan, a fast bowler with a level-headed calmness and a fearsome yorker, found his niche as a death specialist in T20 cricket for England after initially breaking through as a bowling allrounder in Tests and ODIs. "
Adil Rashid,England,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/319700/319741.png","Adil Rashid did much to set right English cricket's troubled relationship with legspin when he established himself as the country's leading white-ball spinner in 2015 and four years later was a key part of their World Cup-winning side. At the time of Rashid's recall to the limited-overs set-up in 2015, no legspinner had taken more than five white-ball wickets for England; over the next six years, Rashid took more than 200."
Saqib Mahmood,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Fast medium,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323000/323019.png","Saqib Mahmood announced himself as a bowler of international class during England's ODI series against Pakistan in 2021. England were forced to pick a completely new squad at short notice after a number of Covid-19 cases were detected in their initial group leaving Mahmood to take the new ball in the first ODI in Cardiff; he dismissed Imam-ul-Haq and Babar Azam inside three balls, finished with 4 for 42, and was named player of the series as England romped to a 3-0 win."
Tymal Mills,England,Right hand Bat,Left arm Fast,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323104.png","Tymal Mills won an England recall for the 2021 T20 World Cup after four-and-a-half years in the international wilderness, during which time regular injuries had threatened his career. Mills, one of the most explosive fast bowlers in English cricket and an innovative thinker about the short-form game, was diagnosed with a congenital back condition in 2015 - his spinal cord and vertebrae are unusually close together and bowling fast too often can agitate his spinal cord - which consigned him to a career as a T20 specialist but he embraced life on the franchise circuit."
Brandon King,West Indies,Right hand Bat,,Top order Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321900/321983.png","Brandon King got his start as a solid middle-order batter for Jamaica before a promotion to the top order in the CPL unlocked his power-hitting potential, and culminated in a call-up to West Indies' white-ball side."
Shai Hope,West Indies,Right hand Bat,,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320100/320122.png","Shai Hope made his Test debut as a 21-year-old, having played just 14 first-class matches at the time. But few in the Caribbean doubted his talent as a batsman. Clive Lloyd gave him his West Indies cap, and coach Stuart Law insisted that he only needed one innings to get going. The world eventually got to know why the boy from Barbados was rated so highly when he became the first player, in 534 first-class matches, to score a hundred in each innings at Headingley."
Nicholas Pooran,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320100/320109.png","Nicholas Pooran confirmed his status as one of the most exciting young batting talents in the modern game with a sublime innings of 118 off 103 in West Indies' defeat to Sri Lanka at the 2019 World Cup, but only four years earlier the idea that he would play international cricket seemed fanciful."
Darren Bravo,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Top order Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316616.png","Darren Bravo is living proof that imitation is the best form of flattery and learning. Only he chose to do it with one of the most inimitable masters of the game. To try to imitate is one thing, to pull it off at Test level, to imbibe it so much that it becomes you, is quite another. Brian Lara's cousin and Dwayne Bravo's half-brother, the younger Bravo, used to watch cricket only for Lara. As soon as Lara would get out, Bravo would switch off the TV and go out to bat."
Kieron Pollard,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batting Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/320100/320107.png","Kieron Pollard had a batting average of 11.30 from 15 ODIs and 17.20 from 10 T20Is when he became the joint-biggest buy at the IPL player auction in January 2010. Mumbai Indians weren't paying $750,000 (plus an undisclosed amount to break a tie with three other franchises) for Pollard's international record; they were shelling out all that money for the fearsome hitting power he had shown in domestic T20 action - most notably while smashing 54 off 18 balls for T&T against New South Wales during the 2009 Champions League T20."
Jason Holder,West Indies,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium fast,Bowling Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/316600/316673.png","Jason Holder was seen as a future talent until a selection panel headed by former World Cup-winner Clive Lloyd appointed him West Indies' ODI captain in 2014. Holder was only 23 at the time, and was still making his way as a fast bowler and a lower-middle order batsman. Less than a year later, he took over the Test team too, indicating how much the WICB and men in the know - ranging from Viv Richards to Brian Lara to Tony Cozier - believed in this man, who comes across as remarkably level-headed and mature for someone so young. "
Akeal Hosein,West Indies,Left hand Bat,Slow Left arm Orthodox,Bowler,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/321900/321939.png","Akeal Hosein was handed a chance to impress for West Indies in Bangladesh in early 2021 after several senior players opted out of the tour, but his opportunity had been a long time coming.

Liam Livingstone,England,Right hand Bat,Legbreak,Batting Allrounder,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/323100/323103.png","The sense that Liam Livingstone is a domineering batting talent who will end up playing all three formats for England was strengthened by an excellent maiden Championship double-century for Lancashire against Warwickshire at Old Trafford in 2017. He had begun the season billed as the ""belligerent face of England's next generation"" after a successful England Lions tour of Sri Lanka, and England took an early look at him with two T20 appearances against South Africa before deciding that he needed more time to craft his game at county level. That double-hundred suggested his research was coming along just fine."
Philip Salt,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Offbreak,Wicketkeeper Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/324200/324245.png","Phil Salt's fearless ball-striking at the top of the Sussex order earned him attention from across the global T20 circuit and a maiden England call-up in 2019, though he was made to wait until 2021 for his debut when he performed a passable impression of Jason Roy in the Covid-hit ODI series against Pakistan."
Harry Brook,England,Right hand Bat,Right arm Medium,Batter,"https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_square_w_160/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/324200/324246.png","A former England U19s captain, Harry Brook announced himself as a player with a bright future with a remarkable T20 Blast season in 2020, averaging 55 and striking at 163 in the group stages despite batting in the middle order."

Encouraging displays for Sussex led to an England ODI call-up - though Covid-19 scuppered chances of a debut - and he went on to help Southern Brave to glory in the inaugural men's Hundred, subsequently winning an IPL deal to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore."

After making his BBL debut for the Brisbane Heat in 2013-14, his initial forays into state cricket came for Queensland, but in 2015 he signed a rookie deal with Tasmania. After a few years of hovering on the fringes of domestic cricket, McDermott blasted into the spotlight in the 2016-17 BBL when he smashed 114 off 52 balls to set the Hobart Hurricanes on the path to a remarkable win at Etihad Stadium, chasing down the Melbourne Renegades' score of 222, which had been the highest total in BBL history. His innings was also, at the time, the second-highest individual score in BBL history.ESPNcricinfo staff"

That followed consecutive 400-plus run seasons for Scorchers in the BBL - where his adaptability at moving from the top order to the middle was noted by selectors - and having continued to flay runs in county cricket for Leicestershire he was named in Australia's 2021 T20 World Cup despite not being part of any of the previous series.

It is not just his power that worries opposing bowlers and captains. His ability to make unconventional shots appear routine - reverse sweeps and pulls, for example - makes it hard to set fields to cover all of his scoring areas. His audacity comes with risk, and he can exasperate as well as exhilarate, but at his best he can change a game in moments."

A left-armer called Mitchell has been a staple of Australia's attack for more than a decade and seems set to remain so for the foreseeable future. While Johnson was more express, Starc is still quick enough to make life uncomfortable for opposition batsmen, especially with the bounce gained from his 1.96m height - and boasts greater control of swing than his former colleague. Never was that shown to greater effect than during the 2015 World Cup, when Starc was at times unplayable, his inswingers rattling stumps and trapping batsmen in front throughout the competition. Not surprisingly he was named Player of the Tournament for his 22 victims at 10.18, and four years later he would claim 27 wickets at the World Cup in England when Australia's defence ended in the semi-finals."

Although he was only 23 at the time, the baggy green had felt a long time coming, given that Hazlewood had been highly regarded for so long. At 17, he had become the youngest fast bowler to be selected by New South Wales, and at 19 he was in his first one-day international against England at Southampton, joining Craig McDermott and Ray Bright as the only Australian 19-year-olds to play the format so soon.

Mushfiqur was principally selected as an understudy to the ever-present wicketkeeper, Khaled Mashud, but his inclusion was further evidence of Bangladesh's determination to build for a better future. He had done well on an A-team tour of Zimbabwe earlier in 2005, scoring a century in the first Test at Bulawayo, and also enjoyed some success in England the previous year with the Under-19s, making 88 in the second Test at Taunton. He showed more evidence of grit with the full team, with a maiden first-class half-century to soften the pain of defeat against Sussex, followed by a career-best 115 against Northamptonshire. That earned him a call-up - as a batsman - to become the youngest player to appear in a Test match at Lord's. He was one of only three players to reach double figures in a disappointing first innings, but a twisted ankle kept him out of the second Test. After captaining Bangladesh's Under-19s to fifth place in the Youth World Cup in February 2006, he also featured in Bogra's inaugural Test, against Sri Lanka the following month, but could make little of the spin of Murali and Malinga Bandara. He remained on the sidelines for the next few months but was recalled for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe at home in December.

Having taken a while to establish himself as a first-class cricketer, he enjoyed a breakthrough 2013-14 season, laying the foundation for Karnataka's Ranji Trophy victory with 1033 runs, which included three centuries, three nineties, and a Man-of-the-Match performance in the final."

He first came to attention when he  played for Kenya in the Logan Cup, but in three outings took only 1 for 166. He was, however, considered one of the best young prospects and one observer noted that he deserved far more success as he beats the bat so often. He has no pretensions as a batsman - he made five ducks in his first seven first-class outings. He was nevertheless rewarded with selection for the full Kenya side in the Twenty20 World Championship.

He has been a cricketer since he could see over the top of a pair of pads at the age of six, he is unusual in that he opens the batting in all three formats, and he is no mean left-arm spinner. Smuts was part of the South African squad that reached the semi-finals of the Under-19 World Cup against Pakistan in Sri Lanka in 2007-08. In fact, it was Smuts' 58 - which earned him Man-of-the-Match honours - that put the South Africans in the final, which they lost to India. Smuts was also in the South African squad that won the 2010 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia.
But it took Smuts several seasons before he was able to break through at the highest level. Despite finishing fifth in the first-class competition's batting charts in the 2011-12 season, when he averaged 43.64, Smuts positioned himself more as a limited-overs cricketer. He was third among run-scorers in the 2014-15 season's one-day cup, scoring 592 runs at 59.20 with six fifties to his name. His reputation for big hitting earned him a CPL contract in 2016.

But a lack of respect, for opposition bowlers at least, has served Gayle well since then. Tall and imposing at the crease, he loves to carve through the covers off either foot, and has the ability to decimate the figures of even the thriftiest of opening bowlers.

He added five in his first overseas Test, and six in his first one-day international. With a round-arm action not unlike Jeff Thomson's, which has left him vulnerable to back strains, he was more of a prot?g? of his neighbour Corey Collymore than his half-brother Pedro Collins.

He made his cricketing debut in 2007, against Khulna Division, for whom his hero Mashrafe Mortaza plays. That didn't stop him from bouncing Mortaza and picking up his wicket during their first encounter at a local competition. When Hossain entered the domestic scene, there were instances of batsmen retiring hurt because of his stock delivery. His love for speed also explains his fascination for bikes. "

Seelaar is not a great spinner of the ball but his economy rate is good and, despite being just 21 years old, knows his game well.

While Michael hasn't cemented his Otago spot yet, Doug Bracewell was picked in the national squad at the age of 21, when New Zealand toured Zimbabwe in October 2011. He took four wickets in his first two Twenty20 internationals and three in his first two ODIs, impressing with his pace. A spate of injuries in the New Zealand squad led to a Test debut for Bracewell in Bulawayo, and he took six in that game to make a quick impact. The Hobart performance reinforced the feeling that Bracewell could be a vital cog in New Zealand's bowling wheels for years to come.ESPNcricinfo staff "

With a bouncing, high-kneed approach to the crease and a bagful of variations, his initial value to Afghanistan was as an enterprising legspinner but his batting has become increasingly useful. He pays precious little regard to the textbook, but Shenwari's good eye means that when he hacks violently at the ball, more often than not he connects and he's crept up from Afghanistan's lower order into their middle. He's also a capable fielder, and is often stationed at point. Shenwari helped to engineer Afghanistan's historic win over Bangladesh at the Asia Cup in March 2014, sharing in a 164-run stand with Asghar Stanikzai and then picking up the vital wicket of Mominul Haque. He has been part of all of Afghanistan's World T20 campaigns, and was shortlisted for the prize of ICC Associate and Affiliate player of the year in 2014. He was an automatic pick for the team that travelled to the 2015 World Cup.Liam Brickhill"

He'd come into contention for national honours when he was Afghanistan's second-highest wicket-taker with 11 wickets in the Under-19 World Cup Qualifiers in 2009. He remained in the frame after his debut and played a useful role in Afghanistan's qualification for the 2012 World T20. His progress has been most marked in first-class cricket, with his 6 for 57 against Scotland in the Intercontinental Cup a particular highlight. His career suffered a setback in 2014, when he missed much of the year due to injury, but he returned to the squad ahead of the 2015 World Cup as a non-travelling reserve.Liam Brickhill"

A right-hand batsman and legspinner, he was part of the Zimbabwe squad to the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia and will tour New Zealand with the side in 2010. ""Tyno"", as he is nicknamed, took up cricket at the age of nine and has represented Zimbabwe U-13s, U-14s and U-16 as well. His more recent achievements include scoring 43 at No. 8 against Pakistan U-19s in an unofficial ODI in October 2009 and picking up 4 for 27 against the same team in the same series. His cricket hero is Shane Warne, and he dreams of being a pilot if he is unable to become a professional cricketer.

A tall seam bowler, he hits the pitch hard and can get good away movement - but as with many young quick bowlers consistency is his major problem. Technically, he has a good action but a better brace of his front leg through his delivery stride would allow him to make the most of his height, rather than collapsing as he tends to do at the moment. He made his ODI debut against England in October 2004 and caused the England top-order a few anxious moments. His early Test appearances did not set the world alight, and he lost his place after taking 3 for 343 in four matches - but he has the basics and anyone with a semblance of talent should be encouraged and nurtured. Mpofu has benefited noticeably from Heath Streak's appointment as Zimbabwe's bowling coach as his action has smoothed out, his outswing is becoming more consistent (although he still has a frustrating propensity to go too wide of off stump) and his pace has increased. One definite shortcoming, however, is his crease occupation. Not content with being stumped twice in an afternoon (for a pair) in the first Test against New Zealand in August 2005, he followed up by being run out for 3 in the second match, as he strolled down the pitch to congratulate his team-mate on reaching his half-century.  He still tends to blow hot and cold and has few rivals in the race to be considered international cricket's worst batsman, but when Zimbabwe return to Test cricket Mpofu will have an important role to play.

Chibhabha has found more success in cricket's shorter formats, where he bats up the order and is also capable of bowling seamers at surprising pace off an apparently leisurely run-up.

His second coming has been far more successful: he enjoyed a breakout 2017-18 season in the white-ball formats, first with Western Australia in the JLT Cup and then, most spectacularly, in the Big Bash with Hobart Hurricanes, where he was the tournament's leading scorer. That earned him an IPL deal and an Australia call-up. He impressed in a T20I tri-series for the national side before struggling in India.
